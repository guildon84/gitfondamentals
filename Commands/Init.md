# git init 
The `git init` command is uesd to create an empty git repository.
If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the gollo wing commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status.md), [add](./commit.md), [commit](./commit.md), [push](./push.md)and more.
Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.

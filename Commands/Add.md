# git add 
When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use `git add` command.
Items that have not been "traked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be maked as modefied. 
Generally, you can get away with the command `git add .` which will add ALL files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.
You can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will track specically file1 and file2. 
you can specify tracking directories with `git add DirectoryName`.
